# Ascend Notes

These are my design notes while I build the project.

## User Stories

-   [ ] A visitor can view all routes.
-   [ ] A visitor can log in to become a user.
-   [ ] A visitor can create a user profile.
-   [ ] A user can view all routes.
-   [ ] A user can create a route.
-   [ ] A user can delete a route that they created.
-   [ ] A user can edit a route that they created.
-   [ ]

## Notes

The `resources` route definition is SUPER cool.

Convention > configuration reminds me of Ruby/Rails.
Though I am stuck on creating a new set of pages for `RouteController`
